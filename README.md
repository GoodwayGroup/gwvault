# gwvault - GoodwayGroup Ansible Vault

> `ansible-vault` CLI reimplemented in go

`ansible-vault` is a very powerful tool and we wanted to simplifying the install and management of the tool as a standalone, cross platform tool.

## Basic Usage

Use in place of `ansible-vault`. All commands are reimplemented. The tool will default to asking for your Vault password.

```
$ gwvault -h
NAME:
   gwvault - encryption/decryption utility for Ansible data files

     decrypt                            decrypt file
     edit                               edit file and re-encrypt
     rekey                              alter encryption password and re-encrypt
     create                             create a new encrypted file
     view                               view contents of encrypted file

     help, h                            Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --vault-password-file VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE          vault password file VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE
   --new-vault-password-file NEW_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE  new vault password file for rekey NEW_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE
   --help, -h                                         show help
   --version, -v                                      print the version
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmarking done using [`bench`](https://github.com/Gabriel439/bench). Execute the `benchmark/run.sh` script to generate a new benchmark.

As compared to `ansible-vault` (v2.9.11 on python v3.8.5), typical actions take a 80% less time to complete.
